# AUTOMATED-FAN-CLEANER

The common problem faced in any house is the cleaning of dust present on top of the fan blades. Due to this dust a wheeze I created which results in most of the respiratory diseases like asthma, dust allergies etc. Timely cleaning of fans requires manpower and are time consuming.
	There are many products in market which are used for fan cleaning like the Fullhouz fan cleaner stick and dust blowers which require man power to operate. Reputed fan companies like Crompton have launched new fans with a tilted blade which are dust repellent and repel about 50% of germs.
	Our project works under three phases namely Set, Clean and Retract. The project is affixed to the top of the fan and is controlled using a Bluetooth based app. The basis fan cleaning equipment like cleaner stick prize ranges from 300-800 INR and the blower cost us 800 INR. The dust repellent fans prize ranges from 2500-4000 INR based on the size of the fan. Our project addresses these problems in an effective and cost-efficient manner and is fully automated.
